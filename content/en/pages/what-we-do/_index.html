    <p>  <br>At  echo - education for collective horizons & organising , we design and facilitate political education that is accessible, participatory, and grounded in real-world struggles. Our work is rooted in  non-formal education , where learning emerges through experience, dialogue, and collective reflection rather than top-down instruction.Our ApproachWe believe that everyone carries experience and knowledge that matters. Our sessions create space for participants to bring their own realities into the room and to learn from one another. To cultivate this, we draw on several intertwined approaches: Holistic Learning We engage the whole person - emotions, body, intellect, and imagination. Our workshops are designed to allow participants to connect with themselves, each other, and the broader systems that shape our lives. Critical Pedagogies Inspired by traditions such as Freirean pedagogy, we invite learners to critically examine structures of power, inequality, and oppression. Through dialogue and reflection, participants uncover how these dynamics shape their experiences and explore possibilities for change. Theatre of the Oppressed We integrate methods from Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed to spark embodied exploration, creativity, and collective problem‑solving. These tools help transform abstract concepts into lived experience and open space for imagining alternatives. Collective Learning & Knowledge Sharing Our spaces are built on the belief that  everyone is an expert  in their own life. We work with group processes that foster peer learning, shared analysis, and collaborative meaning‑making. Interactive & Participatory Methods Our workshops are never passive. We use exercises, games, small‑group work, storytelling, and reflective dialogue to create engaging and dynamic learning environments.What We OfferWe facilitate:  <br>  <br> Workshops and trainings  on topics related to political ecology, degrowth, environmental justice, organising, and social movements.  <br>  <br> Learning journeys  that support long‑term collective reflection and skill‑building.  <br>  <br> Custom educational programs  co-designed with organisations, grassroots groups, and networks.  <br>  <br> Facilitation support  for groups seeking more democratic, caring, and effective ways of working together.  <br> Our CommitmentAcross all our work, we strive to create spaces that are attentive, caring, and grounded in solidarity. Our aim is not only to understand the world but to support the collective capacity to transform it.To learn more about our programs or explore collaboration, you can visit our other pages or reach out to us directly.</p>
