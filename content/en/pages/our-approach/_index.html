    <p>  <br>At echo, we design and facilitate political education that is accessible, participatory, and grounded in real-world struggles. Our work is rooted in non-formal education, where learning emerges through analysis, experience, play, creativity and collective reflection.  We believe that everyone carries experience and knowledge that matters. Our sessions create space for participants to bring their own realities into the room and to learn from one another. To cultivate this, we draw on several intertwined approaches such as  holistic learning,  where we engage the whole person - emotions, body, intellect, and imagination - and looking at the world through a lense of interconnectedness. Our workshops are designed to allow participants to connect with themselves, each other, and the broader systems that shape our lives. Through  critical pedagogies  inspired by traditions such as Freirean pedagogy, we invite people to critically examine structures of power, inequality, and oppression. Through dialogue and reflection, participants uncover how these dynamics shape their experiences and explore possibilities for change.   We integrate methods such as Augusto Boal's  theatre of the oppressed  to spark embodied exploration, creativity, and collective problem‑solving. These tools help transform abstract concepts into lived experience and open space for imagining alternatives. We work with group processes that foster peer learning, shared analysis, and collaborative meaning‑making. Our trainings are always interactive and participatory: we use exercises, games, small‑group work, and storytelling to create engaging and dynamic learning environments. What we offer:  <br>  <br> Workshops and trainings  on topics related to political ecology, degrowth, environmental justice, and systems thinking.  <br>  <br> Custom educational programs  co-designed with organisations, grassroots groups, and networks.  <br>  <br> Facilitation support  for groups seeking more horizontal, caring, and effective ways of working together.  <br> Across all our work, we strive to create spaces that are attentive, caring, and grounded in solidarity. Our aim is not only to understand the world but to support the collective capacity to transform it.
