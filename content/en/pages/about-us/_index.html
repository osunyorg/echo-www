    <p>  <br>echo - education for collective horizons & organising -  is a small collective of political educators dedicated to creating thoughtful, engaging spaces for learning and reflection. We came together after our Master's studies in  Political Ecology, Degrowth & Environmental Justice , where we discovered a shared enthusiasm for political education and exploring how people can learn, think, and act together. Our team is based across different parts of Europe, yet we remain connected through a common commitment: to support accessible, critical, and caring education. We believe that political education can open up new horizons - helping people understand the structures that shape our world, while also imagining alternative possibilities. In our work we value  solidarity ,  collective learning  and  critical thinking . These principles guide how we design and facilitate all our trainings, workshops, and learning journeys. We aim to create environments where participants feel able to ask questions, share experiences, and build knowledge together.
