    <p>  <br>About the training The training aims to empower young people to navigate a world increasingly shaped by polarisation.  The training uses the framework of nonviolent communication (NVC) as a tool to foster mutual understanding, kindness and transformation in societies that are increasingly polarised. It therefore seeks to equip participants with a solid NVC basis of theoretical knowledge and practical skills of NVC.  This NVC focus will be combined with a transversal focus on systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and the politics of non-violence. From this basis, participants will then practically explore how NVC can be used as a tool to proactively reduce polarisation and create socially meaningful change on three different levels: the individual level (e.g. for empathy with the self and with those that hold different political beliefs), the organisational level (e.g. for conflict resolution mechanisms within groups) and the societal level (e.g. to understand the collective needs underneath societal shifts towards the right). Using a range of creative and non-formal education methods, including embodied exercises that engage the physical, emotional, and cognitive dimensions, the training will help participants think critically about the socio-ecological crisis, and learn how to navigate and communicate in a non-violent manner. By engaging in diverse activities, participants will strengthen their capacity to communicate, articulate, and work towards connection in a violent world. This training seeks to give concrete tools to a generation to envision and actively participate in creating the world they want to live in. What can you expect from this training?  <br> Solid basis of Nonviolent Communication (NVC): Acquire practical skills in applying the NVC framework in conversation (e.g. application of the 4 steps of NVC)  <br> NVC as a tool for social impact: Develop an understanding of what emotions and needs contribute to polarisation in various contexts. And learn how they can use NVC as a tool to proactively reduce polarisation on the individual, organisational and societal levels.  <br> Develop Critical Thinking: Learn to analyse the present challenges of environmental degradation and socio-economic inequality through a critical lens, while envisioning transformative solutions.  <br> Politics of Non-Violence: Gain hands-on experience in imagining and articulating sustainable and equitable alternatives to current paradigms.  <br> Engage in Theatre of the Oppressed: Participate in embodied exercises and artistic activities, based on Theatre of the Oppressed, that engage physical, emotional, and cognitive dimensions for a holistic learning experience.  <br> Become a multiplier for change: Develop follow-up projects to act as multipliers of social change in their local contexts.  <br> For whom is this training?  <br> Youth workers, educators, activists and organisers aged 18-30 who are interested in working on and learning about Non-Violent Communication as a tool for social change  <br> Young people who are  concerned about increasing polarisation in society  <br> Young people who want to gain experience with non-formal education methods </p>
